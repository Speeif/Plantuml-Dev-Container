It is currently not the intention of this project to add full support to either `UML` or `SysML`, but only include the diagram types used by the author when developing systems. `SysML` may be outside of the original scope, however some of its included diagrams are useful in specific situations when modelling a system, or trying to get an overview over the system as a whole - before designing it.
